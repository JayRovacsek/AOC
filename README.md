# AOC-2019
So [last year](https://github.com/JayRovacsek/adventofcode2018) wasn't so crash-hot, hopefully this year I'll have the time to stick to it a little longer :smile:

## What?
https://adventofcode.com/

## Why?
Writing code is fun!

## TODO
Complete implementation and auto-deploy of code as wasm (following: https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/introduction.html)
