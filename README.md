It's a thing, I've tried a few times, I get a little better each time.

## 2018
I had very little idea of what to do, naively assumed a language per day (when I only really knew one/two) was a good idea :facepalm:

## 2019
A first take on :neckbeard: Rust, learnt a lot this year

## 2020
Another take of Rust, this time attempting to utilise WASM to show package capacity to give outputs, this kinda worked but didn't as well as 
I'd like, certainly a fun adventure! :grin:

## 2021
A lazy year utilising Typescript; was fun to avoid pulling inputs locally but ultimately node-overload.

## 2022
¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
